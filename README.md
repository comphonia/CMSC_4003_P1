###Project Part One: Web-Based User Management System


A school project for my Application Database class. It is supposed to be a CRUD interface for an
 oracle db, probably did too much for it. 
 
 ##### Tips for improvement
 - Manage sessions in a cookie or something, it's easy to forget to append url sessionid to every link 
 especially in a large app.
 - Use php `password_hash()` or something else for better password hashing, md5 is not secure.
 - toasts or some notification when an operation is performed.

##### Not Production ready.
